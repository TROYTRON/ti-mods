# Terra Invicta Modding Hub

## Basic Knowledge
- Terra Invicta is currently (as of build 0.1.11) built with Unity 2020.
- Configuration files are located in *\TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\Templates*.
- Localization files (game text) are located in *\TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\Localization\en*.

## Useful Tools
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive): Necessary for creating new AssetBundles to import new assets into the game.
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): Used for creating .webms to add as new councillor portraits to TI.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/): Open-source image editor, useful for preparing new 2D graphics to import into the game.
  - [Older versions archive](https://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/)
- [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases): Used to view and edit the game's code.
  - Note that this is decompiled code, therefore lacks documentation and can be difficult to decipher.
- [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/releases): Allows decompiling the game's AssetBundles to see what's inside.
  - Currently the only known such utility that works with Unity 2020.
- [JSON to CSV](http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm): Enables easier editing of the game's configuration files in spreadsheet format.

## Tutorials
TO DO

## Modding Wishlist
- Ability for code changes to somehow be retained or easily redone across new builds.
- Ability to specify new AssetBundles to be loaded into the game (as opposed to having to repackage existing ones).

## Future Investigation
- Ability to add new sounds (e.g. custom voice packs for councillors) to the game.
- Ability to add new UI elements to the game.
