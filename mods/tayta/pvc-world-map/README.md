HOW TO PLAY:
- Download the zipped archive.
- Right click Terra Invicta in Steam, Manage -> Browse local files.
- Unzip the archive directly into this folder, overwriting files as prompted.
- Start Terra Invicta and click New Game. You should see "Project Valkyrie Core" as the default scenario.

You can still play vanilla, but it requires a config change.
Open TISpaceBodyTemplate.json in any text editor and change "regionoutlines/EarthRegionOutlines_PVC" to "regionoutlines/EarthRegionOutlines". Then start a new game using the Modern Scenario.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- This mod is far from balanced and mostly exists as a proof of concept. This is a LONG way from anything resembling a finished BAHHUGSS mod.
- Many nations' flags and federation / union names are placeholders.
- All nation claims are enabled at start because I didn't want to touch the tech tree at this point. Thus the various Independence / Unification techs will be mostly useless in this version of the mod.
- Absolutely no changes have been made to narrative events, faction plotlines, or alien invasion mechanics.
