# Uploading and Updating Steam Workshop Mods

## Uploading a new mod

When you first upload a mod to Workshop from within Terra Invicta, you will see a screen like this

Selecting the "OPEN MOD FOLDER" button will open a folder in the AppData/LocalLow area, the same place the detailed Player.log is written. This folder will be created in this area

This is the folder you copy your mod contents into. You do not rename the folder. Only copy your mod contents (ideally the working contents from your Mods/Enabled folder). After your mod contents are copied into the folder, navigate back to Terra Invicta and select the "UPLOAD MOD" button.

When your mod is uploaded, a file named "WorkshopItemInfo.xml". This file included the PublishedFileId without which you can't update an existing mod. So it's a good idea to create a backup of this file.

## Updating an existing mod

After you've made an update to your mod and you want to update to Workshop, click "UPDATE EXISTING MOD" button from within the Terra Invicta Mods menu. This will create a dropdown menu of the existing mods you have submitted to Workshop. Select the mod you want to update.

After selecting your mod, click the "OPEN MOD FOLDER" button to take you to the same AppData/LocalLow folder that you copied your files to when you first uploaded your mod. It contains the original upload of the mod, so again copy the working, current files from the Mods/Enabled folder into this folder.

After you have copied the updated files into this folder, navigate back to Terra Invicta and select "UPLOAD MOD" and your updated mod will be uploaded to Workshop.
